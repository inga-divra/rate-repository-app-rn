# Rate Repository App (React Native, Full Stack Open Part 10)

This repository contains my solutions for **Part 10 of the Full Stack Open 2025 course (University of Helsinki)**.  
The project is a React Native application developed step by step through the course exercises.

## Exercise 10.1: Initializing the application

- Set up the application using the **latest Expo version** (Expo SDK 54, React Native 0.81, React 19).  
- In the course material, the teacher used an older SDK (50), but I had difficulties running the app on my phone with Expo Go, so I decided to initialize it with the latest stable version.  
- Verified that the app starts with `npm start` and runs successfully on my mobile device with Expo Go.  
- Created a **GitHub repository** for the project, as required by the exercise.  

**Extra (just for fun):**
- Added a title text: `"I love coding, coffee and cats! 💻☕😸"`  
- Inserted an image of a coding cat into the app 🐱💻

Here is the current look of the app running on my phone:
